#insert a value into an array

The code provided allows the user to insert values into an array and then insert a new value at a specified position within the array. As a general explanation of what the code does:

    Declares an integer array myArray with a size of 15 to accommodate values.
    Declares variables numberOfValues, valueToInsert, and position to store user inputs.
    Prompts the user to enter the number of values they want to insert and reads the input into numberOfValues.
    Prompts the user to enter the specified number of values and stores them in the myArray using a loop.
    Displays the contents of the array to show the current state.
    Prompts the user to enter a value to insert and reads it into valueToInsert.
    Asks the user to enter the position where they want to insert the value and reads it into position.
    Shifts the elements of the array after the specified position one position to the right using a loop.
    Inserts the valueToInsert at the specified position in the array.
    Displays the updated contents of the array to show the final state.

Overall, the code allows the user to dynamically insert values into an array and insert a new value at a specified position within the array. It provides prompts and instructions to guide the user through the process.
